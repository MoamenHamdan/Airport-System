The Airport Management System is a comprehensive project designed to address the 
intricacies involved in efficiently managing an airport's operations, including administration, 
flight scheduling, and passenger interactions. The project encompasses a robust data 
structure implementation, featuring classes for administrators, passengers, airplanes, 
flights, and priority queues, all meticulously designed and integrated to facilitate seamless 
airport management. The primary objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated 
system that not only provides essential functionalities but also prioritizes efficiency and 
user-friendly interactions. By amalgamating data structures, object-oriented programming, 
and user interfaces, the Airport Management System strives to be a valuable tool for airport 
personnel, administrators, and passengers alike
